The provided Java code implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for simulating Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling using Swing and incorporates database storage via JDBC for process information. The program defines a Process class to represent a CPU process, containing fields for process name and burst time. The main GUI class, SJF_CPU_Scheduling_GUI, extends JFrame and provides components like text fields for entering process names and burst times, a list to display added processes, and buttons to trigger process addition and scheduling. Users can input processes, which are then stored in an internal list and displayed on the screen. Upon clicking the "Schedule" button, the processes are sorted by burst time in ascending order (as per SJF algorithm), and the scheduled order is shown in a dialog box. Additionally, after scheduling, the process details are stored in a MySQL database using JDBC, where each process is inserted into a database table. The program handles burst time input validation and catches any SQL exceptions that might occur during database operations, ensuring the program can respond gracefully to errors. This code provides a basic, functional simulation of the SJF scheduling algorithm along with persistent storage for process information.
